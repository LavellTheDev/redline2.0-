				Redline is not your typical brokerage firm. Yes we sell real estate,
				but we more so consider ourselves conveyors of an urban lifestyle. From
				your apartment or condo, down to the latest musician playing at a local spot.
				Our agents are hand-picked. They not only know the ins and outs of the real estate
				business but live, work and play in the city and can provide a complete scope of lifestyle.
				<br><br>Whatever your vibe we’ve got a space for you.

				Let us help share what we find so amazing about city living.
				 A major component of living in an urban environment is outside the home,
				 whether it is the coffee shop or the best punk rock show, cheeseburgers
				 or the best alleyway to take a stroll. Redline believes in connectivity,
				 from our clients and customers, to supporting other local businesses and artists.
				 Boston has so many things to see and do; we are excited to help in pointing out what
				 we are so lucky to be a part of.

						a brownstone and brick home with rolled front windows, maybe a tree
						lined street, and a brief stroll to the Charles River. Hello Back
						Bay. Those streets are more than likely Marlborough Street and
						Commonwealth Ave. Quintessential, yes. Cheesy, no. Beautiful,
						absolutely!
						High-end shopping, check .High-end dining, check.
						Copley Square and the Prudential Center are changing and for the
						better. Check out Mario Batali's brand new Eataly for some fresh
						everything you could possibly imagine in the Pru. If you don't feel
						like the picturesque walk home, just buy a Tesla at the new location.

					Quaint is the word that comes to mind. Gas lamps and brick sidewalks
					make this very little town peaceful and harken back to its beginning
					of 1628. Kind of a mind boggling date in itself. This is a great location
					for families and professionals alike. An urban suburb of sorts , while
					still being only a 10 minute walk to the TD Garden or North End.
					Tangierino Brasserie is a great Moroccan restaurant and hookah lounge.
					George Washington also kicked the British out from here if you’re a
					history buff.

						Melting Pot. A constant flow of shoppers, commuters, residents and

						the old Filene’s Basement building that you may have been wondering

					Sorry, Red Sox. Your reign may be over. There is actually more going on

					Tiger Mama is a flavor explosion. The Verb Hotel is a great vibe to chill.

						JP has forever been a progressive-minded town in Boston. Still remains
						true. Eclectic would be the best word to describe it, from food to social
						activities. If your taste buds are diverse Tres Gatos is an absolute must.
						It's a book store, record store and fine dining in one establishment.
						Pretty much sums up JP in one spot! If you need some fresh ink, check out
						Fat Ram's Pumpkin Tattoo (some of our agents may or may not have quite a
						bit of work from them).

						Fun Fact: The JP in JP Licks stands for Jamaica Plain

					Manhattan-esque. An overused description no doubt, but this is the only
					neighborhood that is actually deserving of the title. The LD is home to
					Boston's original and authentic converted loft space. Formerly the section
					of the city where leather products were manufactured, the warehouses that
					appear to be just buildings have some of the city’s most incredible lofts
					inside. Low key would be a good description. Oh yes, a nationally renowned

					Yes, you can have Italian food here. Throw a stone. Aim for Giacomo’s
					or Lucca; however, if you missed and hit a cannoli at Modern Pastry
					consider it a happy accident. The North End is as Boston as the letter
					“R” isn't but the Rose Kennedy Greenway has added a layer of space that
					has upped the beauty immeasurably. Take a nice stroll at the top of
					Hanover Street and sit at the fountains and find out for yourself. If

					The most changed parcel of land in the city for sure. This place was
					basically empty parking lots, the Children’s Museum and the seafood
					wholesalers. You can still get seafood, but now you can add a steak at
					Del Frisco’s. Enjoy rooftop drinks at Yotel. Play corn hole and swing
					on big lit up swing at Lawn on D. It's a lot. The ICA obviously does

						This is not your father’s Southie. Trade in your corned beef and cabbage
						for street corn at LOCO, the Mexican hotspot. There is an awful lot packed
						into this 3.2 square mile Boston neighborhood. Go for a stroll down memory
						lane at Castle Island and grab a burger, dog and fries for like 10 bucks.
						Swing through the West Side which may just be the best side nowadays.
						West Broadway is lined with nightlife and luxury residences. Yes, there
						is also a beach in Southie, too. The bottom of N Street is our preferred spot.
						Think Chicago met Williamsburg, had a baby and named it Southie.
						Oh, and remember, “dem apples” from Good Will Hunting, that was at the

						The fastest growing neighborhood in Boston! The West End, no longer
						just the home of the Celtics and Bruins but hundreds of residents now
						dwell in these lanes. Arguably West Enders score the best view of the
						Zakim Bridge, unless you live 5 mins up the road in Charlestown.
						Pre-game grub, that isn't a slice of pizza. We favor Ward 8; they say
						Julian Edelman is a regular there.

						<li class="a">yes. creating a trusting relationship is crucial in purchasing real estate. You want to be able to trust that the broker is working in your best interest and develops good symmetry with your style and what you are looking for. This will speed up the process and ultimately make it more enjoyable.</li>
